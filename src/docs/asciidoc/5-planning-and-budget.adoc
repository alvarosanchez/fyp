=== Budget

This section analyses the different costs incurred while developing this project.
 
==== Human resources

To calculate the human resources cost, we are considering a cost of *296 € per day*. The breakdown of such amount is the
following:

* Annual salary of a senior developer with 10+ years of experience: 45,000 €.
* Company costs (social security, supplies): 22,000 €.
* Total cost: 67,000 €.

This information is coming from the personal experience of the author running a consulting company and understanding
the job market in Spain and the United Kingdom.

The maximum amount of working hours per year in Spain in the IT market is 1.808. That's 226 working days.
67,000 / 226 =~ 296 €.
