This chapter explains the starting point with regards to authentication mechanisms in RESTful applications, as well as a
comparision between the existing alternatives.

=== Introduction

In the Grails framework, the option to perform authentication and authorisation is the Spring Security Core plugin.
Before going deeper into it, let's describe first the foundations of the project.

==== The Groovy programming language

Groovy is developed to be a feature rich Java friendly programming language. The idea is to bring features we can find
in dynamic programming languages like Python, Ruby to the Java platform. The Java platform is widely supported and a lot
of developers know Java.

The Groovy web site gives one of the best definitions of Groovy: Groovy is an agile dynamic language for the Java Platform
with many features that are inspired by languages like Python, Ruby and Smalltalk, making them available to Java developers
using a Java-like syntax.

Groovy is closely tied to the Java platform. This means Groovy has a perfect fit for Java developers, because we get
advanced language features like closures, dynamic typing and the meta object protocol within the Java platform. Also we
can reuse Java libraries in our Groovy code.

Groovy is often called a scripting language, but this is not quite true. We can write scripts with Groovy, but also full
blown applications. Groovy is very flexible.

<<<

===== Features

- Dynamic language
- Duck typing
- It is compiled into the Java Virtual Machine • Support closures
- Support operators-overload

===== Differences with Java

Groovy tries to be as natural as possible for Java developers. Here we list all the major differences between Java and Groovy.

====== Default imports

All these packages and classes are imported by default, i.e. you do not have to use an explicit import statement to use them:

[source,groovy]
.Listing {counter:listing}. Default imports in Groovy
----
java.io.*
java.lang.*
java.math.BigDecimal
java.math.BigInteger
java.net.*
java.util.*
groovy.lang.*
groovy.util.*
----

<<<

====== Multi-methods

In Groovy, the methods which will be invoked are chosen at runtime. This is called runtime dispatch or multi-methods. It
means that the method will be chosen based on the types of the arguments at runtime. In Java, this is the opposite: methods
are chosen at compile time, based on the declared types.

The following code, written as Java code, can be compiled in both Java and Groovy, but it will behave differently:

[source,java]
.Listing {counter:listing}. Method dispatching code in Java/Groovy
----
int method(String arg) {
    return 1;
}
int method(Object arg) {
    return 2;
}
Object o = "Object";
int result = method(o);
----

In Java, you would have:

[source,java]
.Listing {counter:listing}. Method dispatch in Java
----
assertEquals(2, result);
----


Whereas in Groovy:

[source,groovy]
.Listing {counter:listing}. Method dispatch in Groovy
----
assertEquals(1, result);
----

That is because Java will use the static information type, which is that o is declared as an `Object`, whereas Groovy will
choose at runtime, when the method is actually called. Since it is called with a `String`, then the String version is called.

<<<

====== Array initialisers

In Groovy, the `{ ... }` block is reserved for closures. That means that you cannot create array literals with this syntax:

[source,groovy]
.Listing {counter:listing}. Invalid syntax to declare an array in Groovy
----
int[] array = { 1, 2, 3}
----

You actually have to use:

[source,groovy]
.Listing {counter:listing}. Array declaration in Groovy
----
int[] array = [1,2,3]
----

====== Package scope visibility

In Groovy, omitting a modifier on a field doesn't result in a package-private field like in Java:

[source,groovy]
.Listing {counter:listing}. Default visibility in Groovy
----
class Person {
    String name
}
----

Instead, it is used to create a property, that is to say a private field, an associated getter and an associated setter.

It is possible to create a package-private field by annotating it with `@PackageScope`:

[source,groovy]
.Listing {counter:listing}. Package scope visibility in Groovy
----
class Person {
    @PackageScope String name
}
----

<<<

====== ARM blocks

ARM (Automatic Resource Management) block from Java 7 are not supported in Groovy. Instead, Groovy provides various 
methods relying on closures, which have the same effect while being more idiomatic. For example:

[source,java]
.Listing {counter:listing}. Automatic resource management in Java
----
Path file = Paths.get("/path/to/file");
Charset charset = Charset.forName("UTF-8");
try (BufferedReader reader = Files.newBufferedReader(file, charset)) {
    String line;
    while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
        System.out.println(line);
    }

} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
----

can be written like this:

[source,groovy]
.Listing {counter:listing}. Using Groovy closures as an ARM alternative
----
new File('/path/to/file').eachLine('UTF-8') {
   println it
}
----

or, if you want a version closer to Java:

[source,groovy]
.Listing {counter:listing}. ARM in Groovy, alternative edition
----
new File('/path/to/file').withReader('UTF-8') { reader ->
   reader.eachLine {
       println it
   }
}
----

<<<

====== Inner classes

The implementation of anonymous inner classes and nested classes follows the Java lead, but you should not take out the
Java Language Spec and keep shaking the head about things that are different. The implementation done looks much like what
we do for `groovy.lang.Closure`, with some benefits and some differences. Accessing private fields and methods for example
can become a problem, but on the other hand local variables don't have to be final.


* Static inner classes

Here's an example of static inner class:

[source,groovy]
.Listing {counter:listing}. Static inner class in Groovy
----
class A {
    static class B {}
}

new A.B()
----

The usage of static inner classes is the best supported one. If you absolutely need an inner class, you should make it a static one.

* Anonymous Inner Classes

[source,groovy]
.Listing {counter:listing}. Anonymous inner class in Groovy
----
import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit

CountDownLatch called = new CountDownLatch(1)

Timer timer = new Timer()
timer.schedule(new TimerTask() {
    void run() {
        called.countDown()
    }
}, 0)

assert called.await(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
----

<<<

* Creating Instances of Non-Static Inner Classes

In Java you can do this:

[source,java]
.Listing {counter:listing}. Non-static inner classes in Groovy
----
public class Y {
    public class X {}
    public X foo() {
        return new X();
    }
    public static X createX(Y y) {
        return y.new X();
    }
}
----

Groovy doesn't support the `y.new X()` syntax. Instead, you have to write `new X(y)`, like in the code below:

[source,groovy]
.Listing {counter:listing}. Instantiating non-static inner classes in Groovy
----
public class Y {
    public class X {}
    public X foo() {
        return new X()
    }
    public static X createX(Y y) {
        return new X(y)
    }
}
----

Caution though, Groovy supports calling methods with one parameter without giving an argument. The parameter will then
have the value null. Basically the same rules apply to calling a constructor. There is a danger that you will write
`new X()` instead of `new X(this)` for example. Since this might also be the regular way we have not yet found a good way
to prevent this problem.

<<<

====== Lambdas

Java 8 supports lambdas and method references:

[source,java]
.Listing {counter:listing}. Lambdas in Java
----
Runnable run = () -> System.out.println("Run");
list.forEach(System.out::println);
----

Java 8 lambdas can be more or less considered as anonymous inner classes. Groovy doesn't support that syntax, but has
closures instead:

[source,groovy]
.Listing {counter:listing}. Closures in Groovy as an alternative to Java lambdas
----
Runnable run = { println 'run' }
list.each { println it } // or list.each(this.&println)
----

====== GStrings

As double-quoted string literals are interpreted as `GString` values, Groovy may fail with compile error or produce
subtly different code if a class with `String` literal containing a dollar character is compiled with Groovy and Java compiler.

While typically, Groovy will auto-cast between `GString` and `String` if an API declares the type of a parameter, beware
of Java APIs that accept an Object parameter and then check the actual type.

====== String and Character literals

Singly-quoted literals in Groovy are used for `String`, and double-quoted result in `String` or `GString`, depending
whether there is interpolation in the literal.

[source,groovy]
.Listing {counter:listing}. String definitions in Groovy
----
assert 'c'.getClass() == String
assert "c".getClass() == String
assert "c${1}".getClass() in GString
----

<<<

Groovy will automatically cast a single-character `String` to char when assigning to a variable of type `char`. When
calling methods with arguments of type char we need to either cast explicitly or make sure the value has been cast in
advance.

[source,groovy]
.Listing {counter:listing}. Groovy String to char conversion
----
char a = 'a'
assert Character.digit(a, 16) == 10 : 'But Groovy does boxing'
assert Character.digit((char) 'a', 16) == 10

try {
  assert Character.digit('a', 16)==10
  assert false: 'Need explicit cast'
} catch(MissingMethodException e) {
}
----

Groovy supports two styles of casting and in the case of casting to `char` there are subtle differences when casting a
multi-char strings. The Groovy style cast is more lenient and will take the first character, while the C-style cast will
fail with exception.

[source,groovy]
.Listing {counter:listing}. String casting in Groovy
----
// for single char strings, both are the same
assert ((char) "c").class == Character
assert ("c" as char).class == Character

// for multi char strings they are not
try {
  ((char) 'cx') == 'c'
  assert false: 'will fail - not castable'
} catch(GroovyCastException e) {
}
assert ('cx' as char) == 'c'
assert 'cx'.asType(char) == 'c'
----

====== Behaviour of `==`

In Java `==` means equality of primitive types or identity for objects. In Groovy `==` translates to `a.compareTo(b)==0`,
if they are `Comparable`, and `a.equals(b)` otherwise. To check for identity, there is `is`. E.g. `a.is(b)`.

<<<

====== Different keywords

There are a few more keywords in Groovy than in Java. Don't use them for variable names etc.

* `in`.
* `trait`.

==== Examples

[source,groovy]
.Listing {counter:listing}. Hello world in Groovy
----
println "hello world" // (1)
----
(1) The simplest Groovy code is a script. As this is going to be compiled to Java anyways, the Groovy compiler takes
care of all the noise required by Java: it generates a class with a `main` method calling your code.

<<<

[source,groovy]
.Listing {counter:listing}. Basic syntax elements in Groovy
----
class Team { // (1)

    String name // (1)
    BigDecimal budget
    List<Player> squad = [] // (2)

}

class Player { String name, int age }

Team realMadrid = new Team(name: 'Real Madrid CF', players:[new Player(name: 'Cristiano Ronaldo'), ...]) (3)
realMadrid.budget = 100_000_000 // (4)

def youngPlayers = realMadrid.players.collect { it.age < 20} // (5)
----
(1) Groovy applies common sense default for visibilities: public for classes and methods and private for attributes

(2) There is native grammar syntax for lists (`[a,b,c]`) and maps (`[a: b, c: d]`)

(3) Groovy enhances constructors with named parameters

(4) Getters and setters are auto-generated and hidden. Property-access assignments are calling implicit setters. It also
    honours Java 7 Project Coin's features such as numeral literal formatting

(5) Groovy super-vitamines the JDK with many methods in the collections, file, etc API's with the so called GDK.

=== Grails framework

Java web development as it stands today is dramatically more complicated than it needs to be. Most modern web frameworks
in the Java space are over complicated and don't embrace the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principles.

Dynamic frameworks like Rails, Django and TurboGears helped pave the way to a more modern way of thinking about web
applications. Grails builds on these concepts and dramatically reduces the complexity of building web applications on the
Java platform. What makes it different, however, is that it does so by building on already established Java technologies
like Spring and Hibernate.

Grails is a full stack framework and attempts to solve as many pieces of the web development puzzle through the core
technology and its associated plugins. Included out the box are things like:

* An easy to use Object Relational Mapping (ORM) layer built on Hibernate
* An expressive view technology called Groovy Server Pages (GSP)
* A controller layer built on Spring MVC
* An interactive command line environment and build system based on Gradle
* An embedded Tomcat container which is configured for on the fly reloading
* Dependency injection with the inbuilt Spring container
* Support for internationalization (i18n) built on Spring's core MessageSource concept
* A transactional service layer built on Spring's transaction abstraction

All of these are made easy to use through the power of the Groovy language and the extensive use of Domain Specific Languages (DSLs)

<<<

==== Domains

Grails has an abstract domain layer called GORM: Grails Object Relational Mapping. Despite of it's name, it has support
for multiple data storage systems, bot SQL and No-SQL, such as Hibernate (for relational databases), MongoDB, CouchDB,
Neo4j and Redis.

This is an example of how Grails domains work:

[source,groovy]
.Listing {counter:listing}. Grails GORM examples
----
class Person {
    String name
    Integer age
    Date lastVisit

    static hasMany = [pets: Pet]
}

class Pet {
    String name

    static belongsTo = [owner: Person]
}

//Create
def p = new Person(name: "Fred", age: 40, lastVisit: new Date())
p.save()

//Read
def fred = Person.get(1)
assert 'Fred' == fred.name

//Update
def bob = Person.findByName("Fred")
bob.name = "Bob"
bob.save(flush: true)
assert 'Bob' == Person.get(1).name

//Delete
bob.delete()

//Relationships
def john == new Person(name: "John", age: 40, lastVisit: new Date()).addToPets(name: "floppy").save()
assert Pet.get(1).name == "floppy"
----

<<<

==== The web layer

===== Controllers

A controller handles requests and creates or prepares the response. A controller can generate the response directly or
delegate to a view.

[source,groovy]
.Listing {counter:listing}. Grails Controller examples
----
import grails.converters.JSON

class PersonController {

    /** Accessible through /person */
    def index() {
        List<Person> people = Person.list()

        //Generates a JSON response directly
        render people as JSON
    }

    /** Accessible through /person/show/123 */
    def show(Long id) {
        Person person = Person.get(id)
        if (person) {
            //Delegates to /grails-app/views/person/show.gsp, where the model is the map [person: person]
            return [person: person]
        } else {
            response.sendError(404)
        }
    }
}
----

<<<

===== Views

Groovy Servers Pages (or GSP for short) is Grails' view technology. It is designed to be familiar for users of
technologies such as ASP and JSP, but to be far more flexible and intuitive.

GSP's live in the `grails-app/views` directory and are typically rendered automatically (by convention) or with the
render method such as:

[source,groovy]
----
render(view: "index")
----

A GSP is typically a mix of mark-up and GSP tags which aid in view rendering.

Although it is possible to have Groovy logic embedded in your GSP, the practice is strongly discouraged. Mixing mark-up
and code is a bad thing and most GSP pages contain no code and needn't do so.

A GSP typically has a "model" which is a set of variables that are used for view rendering. The model is passed to the
GSP view from a controller. Given the `show` action from the controllers example, a GSP could look like this:

[source,html]
.Listing {counter:listing}. Grails GSP example
----
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>${person.name}</h1>
    <p>Pets:</p>
    <ul>
      <g:each in="${person.pets}" var="pet">
        <li>${pet.name}</li>
      </g:each>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
----

=== OAuth 2.0

The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service,
either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP
service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.  This specification replaces and
obsoletes the OAuth 1.0 protocol described in RFC 5849.

==== Roles

OAuth defines four roles:

. *Resource owner*: an entity capable of granting access to a protected resource. When the resource owner is a person, it
  is referred to as an end-user.

. *Resource server*:  the server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting and responding to protected resource
  requests using access tokens.

. *Client*: an application making protected resource requests on behalf of the resource owner and with its authorization.
  The term "client" does not imply any particular implementation characteristics (e.g., whether the application executes
  on a server, a desktop, or other devices).

. *Authorization server*: the server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource
  owner and obtaining authorization.


The interaction between the authorization server and resource server is beyond the scope of the specification.  The
authorization server may be the same server as the resource server or a separate entity. A single authorization server
may issue access tokens accepted by multiple resource servers.

ifdef::generate-diagrams[]
[plantuml, oauth-flow, png]
....
Client -> ResourceOwner: (1) Authorization Request
ResourceOwner --> Client: (2) Authorization Grant

Client -> AuthorizationServer: (3) Authorization Grant
AuthorizationServer --> Client: (4) Access Token

Client -> ResourceServer: (5) Access Token
ResourceServer --> Client: (6) Protected Resource
....
endif::[]

.OAuth 2.0 flow
image::oauth-flow.png[]

. The client requests authorization from the resource owner. The authorization request can be made directly to the
  resource owner (as shown), or preferably indirectly via the authorization server as an intermediary.

. The client receives an authorization grant, which is a credential representing the resource owner's authorization,
  expressed using one of four grant types defined in this specification or using an extension grant type. The
  authorization grant type depends on the method used by the client to request authorization and the types supported by
  the authorization server.

. The client requests an access token by authenticating with the authorization server and presenting the
  authorization grant.

. The authorization server authenticates the client and validates the authorization grant, and if valid, issues an
  access token.

. The client requests the protected resource from the resource server and authenticates by presenting the access token.

. The resource server validates the access token, and if valid, serves the request.

=== Asciidoctor

This document has been produced using Asciidoctor.

Asciidoctor is a fast text processor and publishing toolchain for converting AsciiDoc content to HTML5, DocBook 5
(or 4.5) and other formats. Asciidoctor is written in Ruby, packaged as a RubyGem and published to RubyGems.org.

AsciiDoc belongs to the family of lightweight markup languages, the most renowned of which is Markdown. AsciiDoc stands
out from this group because it supports all the structural elements necessary for drafting articles, technical manuals,
books, presentations and prose. In fact, it’s capable of meeting even the most advanced publishing requirements and
technical semantics.

Here’s a basic example of an AsciiDoc document:

=== Gradle

Gradle is the build system used to produce this document in different formats, such as PDF and HTML.

Gradle provides:

* A very flexible general purpose build tool like Ant.
* Switchable, build-by-convention frameworks a la Maven. But we never lock you in!
* Very powerful support for multi-project builds.
* Very powerful dependency management (based on Apache Ivy).
* Full support for your existing Maven or Ivy repository infrastructure.
* Support for transitive dependency management without the need for remote repositories or pom.xml and ivy.xml files.
* Ant tasks and builds as first class citizens.
* Groovy build scripts.
* A rich domain model for describing your build.

You run a Gradle build using the `gradle` command. The `gradle` command looks for a file called `build.gradle` in the
current directory. This `build.gradle` file is called a build script, although strictly speaking it is a build
configuration script. The build script defines a project and its tasks.
