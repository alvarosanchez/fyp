This chapter explains the starting point with regards to authentication mechanisms in RESTful applications, as well as a
comparision between the existing alternatives.

=== Introduction

In the Grails framework, the option to perform authentication and authorisation is the Spring Security Core plugin.
Before going deeper into it, let's describe first its foundations: the Groovy programming language and the Grails
framework.

==== The Groovy programming language

Groovy is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language for the Java Platform. It is compiled into Java Bytecode. Its
design has been influenced by Python, Ruby, Perl and Smalltalk. It was designed by James Strachan and Guillaume LaForge
in 2003. It supports multiple programming paradigms, such as functional, imperative and object-oriented.

===== Features

- Dynamic language
- Duck typing
- It is compiled into the Java Virtual Machine â€¢ Support closures
- Support operators-overload

===== Syntax

- Indentation is not mandatory
- Semicolons are not mandatory. They can be used for writing more than one statement in a line
- It uses a Java-like bracket syntax

In <<listing-hw>> we can see how a _hello world_ looks like in Groovy.

[[listing-hw]]
[source,groovy]
.Listing {counter:listing}. Hello world in Groovy
----
println "Hello world!"
