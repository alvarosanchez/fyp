=== Introduction

The methodology used to develop this project is *Scrum*.

Scrum is an agile process most commonly used for product development, especially software development. Scrum is a
project management framework that is applicable to any project with aggressive deadlines, complex requirements and a
degree of uniqueness. In Scrum, projects move forward via a series of iterations called sprints. Each sprint is typically
two to four weeks long.

Scrum defines the following concepts:

* *Scrum team*: A typical scrum team has between five and nine people, but Scrum projects can easily scale into the
  hundreds. However, Scrum can easily be used by one-person teams and often is. This team does not include any of the
  traditional software engineering roles such as programmer, designer, tester or architect. Everyone on the project
  works together to complete the set of work they have collectively committed to complete within a sprint. Scrum teams
  develop a deep form of camaraderie and a feeling that “we’re all in this together.”

* *Product owner*: The product owner is the project’s key stakeholder and represents users, customers and others in the
  process. The product owner is often someone from product management or marketing, a key stakeholder or a key user.

* *Scrum Master*: The Scrum Master is responsible for making sure the team is as productive as possible. The Scrum Master
  does this by helping the team use the Scrum process, by removing impediments to progress, by protecting the team from
  outside, and so on.

* *Product backlog*: The product backlog is a prioritized features list containing every desired feature or change to the
  product. Note: The term “backlog” can get confusing because it’s used for two different things. To clarify, the product
  backlog is a list of desired features for the product. The sprint backlog is a list of tasks to be completed in a sprint.

* *Sprint planning meeting*: At the start of each sprint, a sprint planning meeting is held, during which the product
  owner presents the top items on the product backlog to the team. The Scrum team selects the work they can complete
  during the coming sprint. That work is then moved from the product backlog to a sprint backlog, which is the list of
  tasks needed to complete the product backlog items the team has committed to complete in the sprint.

* *Daily Scrum*: Each day during the sprint, a brief meeting called the daily scrum is conducted. This meeting helps set
  the context for each day’s work and helps the team stay on track. All team members are required to attend the daily scrum.

* *Sprint review meeting*: At the end of each sprint, the team demonstrates the completed functionality at a sprint
  review meeting, during which, the team shows what they accomplished during the sprint. Typically, this takes the form
  of a demonstration of the new features, but in an informal way; for example, PowerPoint slides are not allowed. The
  meeting must not become a task in itself nor a distraction from the process.

* *Sprint retrospective*: Also at the end of each sprint, the team conducts a sprint retrospective, which is a meeting
  during which the team (including its ScrumMaster and product owner) reflect on how well Scrum is working for them and
  what changes they may wish to make for it to work even better.

=== Analysis

The software requirements are defined through Scrum's *user stories*.

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new
capability, usually a user or customer of the system. They typically follow a simple template:

[quote]
As a <type of user>, I want <some goal> so that <some reason>.

User stories are often written on index cards or sticky notes, stored in a shoe box, and arranged on walls or tables to
facilitate planning and discussion. As such, they strongly shift the focus from writing about features to discussing them.
In fact, these discussions are more important than whatever text is written.

==== User stories

===== #{counter:us}. As a user, I want to authenticate, so that I can access protected resources

The authentication endpoint must enable a client application to login using credentials such as username and password.
It should be RESTful, i.e.: it should consume and produce JSON over HTTP. An example request is like:

[source,javascript]
.Listing {counter:listing}. User Story {us}: authentication endpoint.
----
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Content-Type: application/json
{
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "secret"
}
----

<<<

If the authentication is successful, the response should be like:

[source,javascript]
.Listing {counter:listing}. User Story {us}: successful authentication response.
----
200 OK HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
{
   "username": "admin",
   "roles": [
      "ROLE_ADMIN",
      "ROLE_USER"
   ],
   "expires_in": 3600,
   "token_type": "Bearer",
   "refresh_token": "eyJhbGciOiJSU0EtT0FFUCIsImVuYyI6IkEyNTZHQ00ifQ.fUaSWIdZakFX7CyimRIPhuw0sfevgmwL2xzm5H0TuaqwKx24EafCO0TruGKG-lN-wGCITssnF2LQTqRzQGp0PoLXHfUJ0kkz5rBl6LtnRu7cdD1ZUNYXLJtFjQ3IATzoo15tPafRPyStG1Qm7-1L0VxquhrLxkkpti0F1_VTytZAq8ltFrnxM4ahJUwS7eriivvdLqmHtnwuXw0kBXEseIyCkiyKklWDJAcD_P_gHoQJvSCoXedlr7Pp0n6LEUrRWJ2Hb-Zyt9dWqWDxm9nyDeEVtEZGcQtpgCGgbXxaUpULIy5nvrbRzXSNyT6iXhK1CLqiFVkfh-Y-DHXdB6Q4sg.uYdpxl835KnlkqC5.gBgSnPWZOo6FINovJNG7Xx2RuS09QJbU4-_J4EgZQkygt8xE-HfdYaOmtmJLjGJR1XKoaRsuX1gNjFoCZgqWAon6.Zsrk52dkjskSVQLXZBQooQ",

If the authentication fails, the response should be a `401` HTTP status code.

If the request is invalid, the response shall be a `400` HTTP status code.
