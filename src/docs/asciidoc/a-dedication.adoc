I would like to start offering my gratitude to my parents, as they funded my studies and my cost of living during the
first years of the university.

To Laura, for constantly chasing me to finish this work and get the degree.

To all the companies and people that I have worked with across my 14+ years of experience.

To the open-source community, for being so grateful with the job I have done, and encouraging me to continue working on it.

To Alejandro Calder√≥n, for allowing me to complete this work with such short notice and his dedication towards my success in doing it.
