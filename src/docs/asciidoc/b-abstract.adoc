Nowadays, most of the software is built using the REST architecture. In addition to that, developers are creating
applications where the backend is nomally serving JSON over HTTTP, whereas the front-end is a separate application
built in Javascript, that consumes such REST endpoints.

One of the restrictions of REST is that the systems must be *stateless*, in such a way that the client must transfer
its state to the server on every request. In this scenario, doing authentication and authorisation in a stateless way is
tricky, as the vast majority of the existing solutions are stateful implementations based on the HTTP session.

For this reason was created *Spring Security REST*, a plugin for the Grails framework based on Spring Security that
enables developers to secure their applications in a pure REST, stateless way.
